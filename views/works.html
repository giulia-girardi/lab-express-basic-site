    <p>Barack Obama’s 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father is regarded as one of the best memoirs ever written by an American politician. In 2006, its abridged audio-book version won the Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album. The following year, the memoir also received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Nonfiction. In 2009, President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize “for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples”. He was the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. In 2013, Obama received the Israeli President’s Medal of Distinction, the highest civil medal given by the State of Israel. In 2017, Obama was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest award that is presented by the Secretary of Defense. The same year, he also received the Profile in Courage Award presented by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.</p>
